# 🔧 Wallet Connection Fixes

## 🐛 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Connection Not Restored on Page Reload**
**Problem**: When users revisited a connected website, the existing connection was not properly restored.

**Root Causes**:
- Race condition between `ProviderManager.initializeConnectionState()` and `EVMProvider.initializeSelectedAddress()`
- Hard-coded delays (150ms) were insufficient for some scenarios
- Events were emitted only once, missing dApps that setup listeners later

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Added `emitConnectionEvents()` helper method with multiple retry delays (50ms, 150ms, 300ms, 500ms)
- ✅ Improved synchronization between ProviderManager and EVMProvider
- ✅ Added proper logging for debugging connection restoration
- ✅ Enhanced `getConnectedAccountForSite()` to be more reliable

### 2. **dApps Stuck in Loading State After Connection**
**Problem**: After successful connection, dApps remained in loading state because they didn't receive proper events.

**Root Causes**:
- Events were emitted before dApp listeners were ready
- Duplicate events were being filtered out incorrectly
- No mechanism to ensure dApps received connection events

**Solutions**:
- ✅ Implemented event emission with multiple delays to catch late listeners
- ✅ Added `lastEmitTime` tracking to prevent spam while allowing necessary retries
- ✅ Improved event deduplication logic
- ✅ Enhanced `handleGetAccounts()` to properly sync state and emit events

## 🔄 Key Changes Made

### ProviderManager (`src/background/providers/provider-manager.ts`)

1. **New Helper Methods**:
   ```typescript
   private emitConnectionEvents() {
       // Emit immediately and with delays
       const delays = [50, 150, 300, 500];
       delays.forEach(delay => {
           setTimeout(() => {
               this.emit('connect', connectionData);
               this.emit('accountsChanged', this.accounts);
           }, delay);
       });
   }
   
   private emitDisconnectedState() {
       // Similar pattern for disconnected state
   }
   ```

2. **Improved Connection State Initialization**:
   - Better error handling
   - More detailed logging
   - Consistent use of helper methods

### EVMProvider (`src/background/providers/evm-provider.ts`)

1. **Enhanced Event Handling**:
   ```typescript
   private lastEmitTime: number = 0;
   
   // Prevent duplicate events within 50ms window
   if (this.lastEmitTime && now - this.lastEmitTime < 50) {
       return;
   }
   ```

2. **Improved Account Detection**:
   - Better synchronization with ProviderManager
   - Multiple fallback strategies
   - Proper state updates

3. **Better Initialization Timing**:
   - Delayed EVMProvider initialization to allow ProviderManager to complete first
   - Improved connection detection logic

## 🧪 Testing

A comprehensive test page has been created: `test-connection.html`

**Test Scenarios**:
1. ✅ Fresh connection (first time)
2. ✅ Connection restoration on page reload
3. ✅ Multiple rapid connection attempts
4. ✅ Event listener setup timing
5. ✅ Account switching
6. ✅ Disconnect/reconnect cycles

**How to Test**:
1. Open `test-connection.html` in a browser
2. Connect wallet and verify events are received
3. Reload page and verify connection is restored
4. Check console logs for detailed event flow

## 🎯 Expected Behavior After Fixes

### Connection Restoration:
- ✅ When user revisits a connected site, connection should be restored within 500ms
- ✅ dApp should receive `connect` and `accountsChanged` events
- ✅ `ethereum.selectedAddress` should be populated immediately

### New Connections:
- ✅ Connection popup should appear for new sites
- ✅ After approval, dApp should receive events within 100ms
- ✅ No loading state should persist after successful connection

### Event Reliability:
- ✅ Events are emitted multiple times with delays to catch late listeners
- ✅ Duplicate events are prevented within 50ms windows
- ✅ Proper event data is always included

## 🔍 Debugging

Enhanced logging has been added throughout the connection flow:

```
🔗 Restoring connection for site: https://example.com with account: 0x123...
🔗 EVMProvider: Using existing connection from ProviderManager: 0x123...
🔗 EVMProvider: Emitting connect event from ProviderManager
```

Look for these log messages to trace connection issues.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Test the fixes with real dApps
2. Monitor for any remaining edge cases
3. Consider adding connection health checks
4. Implement connection retry mechanisms for network failures

## 📝 Notes

- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- No breaking changes to the provider API
- Performance impact is minimal (only affects connection initialization)
- Fixes are defensive and handle edge cases gracefully

# 🚀 Purro Extension v0.6.8 - Stability & Compatibility Update

## 🎉 Highlights
- **Enhanced dApp Connection Reliability** with improved connection restoration and event handling
- **Better Wallet Coexistence** with other wallet extensions (especially Rainbow)
- **Optimized Provider Injection** with conflict resolution and secondary provider support
- **Improved EIP-6963 Implementation** with flexible announcement timing
- **Bug Fixes** for connection state management and loading issues
- **Enhanced Debugging** with better logging and error tracking

## ✨ What's New

### 🔗 Enhanced dApp Connection Reliability
- **Connection Restoration**: Fixed race conditions in connection state initialization
- **Multiple Event Emissions**: Added retry delays (50ms, 150ms, 300ms, 500ms) to catch late listeners
- **Better Synchronization**: Improved coordination between ProviderManager and EVMProvider
- **Event Deduplication**: Enhanced logic to prevent spam while allowing necessary retries
- **Loading State Fixes**: Resolved dApps getting stuck in loading state after connection

### 🌈 Wallet Coexistence Improvements
- **Provider Conflict Resolution**: Better handling when multiple wallets are installed
- **Secondary Provider Support**: Can coexist with other wallet providers without conflicts
- **Rainbow Wallet Compatibility**: Specific fixes for Rainbow wallet integration
- **Non-Destructive Injection**: No longer always overwrites existing providers
- **Graceful Fallback**: Maintains functionality even with conflicting extensions

### 🔧 Provider Injection Optimizations
- **Smart Provider Detection**: Checks for existing providers before injection
- **Conditional Injection**: Only injects when no provider exists or adds as secondary
- **Conflict Prevention**: Prevents overwriting other wallet providers
- **Better Error Handling**: Graceful handling of injection failures

### ⚡ EIP-6963 Enhancements
- **Flexible Announcement Timing**: Multiple announcement attempts with varying delays
- **Late Listener Support**: Catches dApps that setup listeners after initial announcements
- **Improved Reliability**: Better success rate for provider discovery
- **Enhanced Logging**: Better debugging capabilities for provider issues

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Connection Management
- **Enhanced `emitConnectionEvents()`**: Helper method with multiple retry delays
- **Improved `getConnectedAccountForSite()`**: More reliable connection state retrieval
- **Better Event Emission**: Proper event data inclusion and timing

### Full description
Purro is a Hyperliquid‑native Chrome extension wallet built for speed, security, and a clean UX. It delivers an ecosystem‑first experience for Hyperliquid and HyperEVM while remaining multichain‑ready by design.

- Hyperliquid focus: Native support for HyperEVM (chainId 999 / 0x3e7) with ecosystem‑aware UX
- In‑app swaps: LiquidSwap routing, slippage control, and WRAP/UNWRAP HYPE ↔ WHYPE
- Gas‑optimized: EIP‑1559 fees with safety buffers and L1/L2‑aware pricing
- Identity built‑in: Hyperliquid Names (.hl) address resolution and profile linking
- Multichain portfolio: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base balances with Alchemy‑powered data
- NFTs: Collection and instance viewing with IPFS support
- For builders: EIP‑1193/6963 provider injection for seamless dApp connections
- Security: Non‑custodial, client‑side encryption, password protection, and auto‑lock

### What Purro does not do yet
- Gasless swaps: Coming soon (today: gas‑optimized execution)
- In‑app bridge: Use ecosystem bridges (e.g., deBridge) directly; in‑app bridging is coming soon

### Who it’s for
- Traders seeking a fast, Hyperliquid‑native experience
- Builders integrating with an EIP‑1193 wallet and .hl identities
- Power users who want a focused, lightweight alternative to bloated wallets

### Notes on data and privacy
- Keys never leave your device; encryption is client‑side
- Minimal, purpose‑driven network calls for on‑chain features only

### Summary
Purro prioritizes depth over breadth—delivering a native‑first, high‑performance experience for Hyperliquid and HyperEVM, with multichain support when you need it.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit them:

### Pull Request Guidelines
- **Title**: Use conventional commit format (e.g., "feat: add token search functionality")

- **Related Issues**: Link any related issues using keywords like "Fixes #123" or "Closes #456"
- **Screenshots**: Include screenshots for UI changes
- **Testing**: Describe how you tested your changes

### Commit Message Format
We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

[optional footer(s)]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix

pnpm run test:encryption

# Run storage tests
pnpm run test:storage

# Full security audit

```

### Testing Guidelines
- Write tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Add integration tests for critical functionality
- Test on different Chrome versions if possible

## Code Style

### TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow strict type checking
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Prefer `const` over `let` when possible

### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Use proper prop types and interfaces
- Keep components focused and reusable

### File Organization
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ background/          # Background scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client/             # React UI components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/             # Static assets
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ types/              # Type definitions
```

### Naming Conventions
- **Files**: kebab-case (e.g., `account-handler.ts`)
- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `AccountSheet.tsx`)
